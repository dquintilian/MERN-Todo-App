# MERN-Todo-App
## Goal: This is a project I undertook to deepen my understanding of full stack development.

The project was built using React, Express, Node and MongoDB

My inspiration for the project was to self teach and fully develop a simple and scalable web application on my own.

Within the application I implemented the ability to create tasks, complete tasks, edit tasks and delete tasks all in a way that was visually organized for the user.

My goal was to intimately understand what the capability of CRUD actions could do and would be neccesary to accomplish each action

One of the most interesting parts of the application structure for me was implementing full JSON web authentication into the application. So that multiple users could use the product and protect their data. I also included functionality to reset your password via sendgrid email api in case it was forgotten.

Lastly it was my goal to make completing each task satisfying by adding in animations and visual changes that made it enticing to complete tasks within the application. 

Also adding functionality for lists was important for me and to enable a more organized approach to list building.

Thank you for checking out my project. I hope this helped you get a better sense of me and my ability to build web applications
